## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

1. Start with segmenting all preexising text into semantic html
2. Create Sass File structure and place preset variables into their respective locations
3. Style mobile design first
4. Setup responsive styles so that the design works for desktops as well.
5. Create javascript interactivity.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project mainly as a way to introduce myself to Sass styling and file organisation.
The major takeaway from this experience is that managing css code by segmenting it into different
files instead of having it be all in one big file, is a major time savor. This will likely mean that all my projects in the future with have at least a preprosessor for css styles that will be used. 

### Continued development

The major area I need to still work on with Sass is improving my actual class naming scheme, and css styling placements. There were a few times that I was confused by where things were located in my sass directories, and because of this, it is imperative that I come up with a more manageable schema to follow and implement changes faster. 

### Useful resources

- [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - This is how I chose to learn, forgoing video tutorials over reading the actual documentation
- [Sass folder structure recommendation](https://dev.to/dostonnabotov/a-modern-sass-folder-structure-330f) - This was an example file structure I followed. It gave me an idea of how I should set things up. I don't know if I will repeat this in the future, but it helped me out quite a bit here as I was figuring things out.

## Acknowledgments

Thankyou to frontend mentor for presenting these designs and allowing me to focus on the actual implentation. Which allows me the opportunity to keep trying out new technologies
